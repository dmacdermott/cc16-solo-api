# Code Chrysalis Project Tracker 📝
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis 👨‍💻.

It was built to keep track of the requirements for all the projects at CC.😰

It is created using a RESTFUL API that allows users to view, add, edit and delete projects.
Each project has the ability to add requirements and keep track of them.👌
